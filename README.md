# Order Sales Data Analysis and Web Application

## Overview
The Order Sales Data Analysis and Web Application project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and modeling of order sales data. This project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle as the foundation for building a MySQL database and a web application. Our goal is to delve into the dynamics of customer behavior, regional trends, and product categories by leveraging this dataset. We aim to extract valuable insights into sales patterns and customer preferences, demonstrating the practical application of database structures and web development within the context of a fictional order sales dataset. This initiative offers a hands-on learning experience in data management, modeling, and web application development in an open dataset environment.
